 activity_HRT_italienzug_desc: "In the long-standing tradition of the Holy Roman Empire, the Italienzug represents a journey of both spiritual and political significance. When a new Emperor is chosen to lead the realm, it is not merely by the will of the princes and the nobility, but by divine right, confirmed by the highest authority in Christendom: the Pope."

Once the heart of a vast empire, it now serves as the spiritual epicenter of Christendom. Its storied streets and grand basilicas bear witness to countless coronations and sacred ceremonies. For an Emperor-elect of the Holy Roman Empire, Rome is not just a destination, but a testament to divine destiny. To be crowned here is to be recognized by God, the Pope, and all of Christendom."
 activity_HRT_italienzug_province_desc: "A bastion of faith and tradition. Though not the ancient capital of Rome, this revered city has become the temporary spiritual heart of Christendom due to the Pope's residence. Its significance is underscored by its role in imperial coronations and sacred ceremonies. For an Emperor-elect of the Holy Roman Empire, journeying here is a pilgrimage of divine affirmation. To be crowned in this city is to gain the blessings of God, the Pope, and the entirety of the Christian realm." # Fallback option
